# ERP Service - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**System Purpose**: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for BengoBox, providing integrated business management across **CRM, HRM, Procurement, Manufacturing, and E-commerce**. The ERP service focuses on these core domains and integrates with specialized microservices (treasury-api, inventory-service, auth-service, notifications-service) for financial, inventory, authentication, and notification capabilities.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Contacts, leads, opportunities, sales pipeline, campaigns
- **Human Resource Management (HRM)**: Employees, payroll, attendance, leave, recruitment, training, performance
- **Procurement**: Purchase requisitions, purchase orders, vendor management, supplier performance
- **Manufacturing**: Work orders, BOM, production planning, quality control
- **E-commerce**: Product catalog, orders, cart, POS operations, vendor management

**Entity Ownership**: This service owns ERP-specific entities: CRM (contacts, leads, opportunities, campaigns), HRM (employees, payroll, attendance, leave), Procurement (purchase orders, requisitions, vendors), Manufacturing (work orders, BOM), E-commerce (products, orders, cart, POS). **ERP does NOT own**: users (references auth-service), tenants (references auth-service), financial transactions (references treasury-api), inventory balances (references inventory-service), notifications (references notifications-service).

**Integration Strategy**: ERP integrates with external microservices instead of duplicating logic:
- **Finance/Accounting** → `treasury-api` (invoices, bills, payments, ledger, reconciliation, expenses, taxes)
- **Inventory Management** → `inventory-service` (stock levels, movements, warehouses)
- **Authentication/Authorization** → `auth-service` (SSO, JWT, user management)
- **Notifications** → `notifications-service` (emails, SMS, push notifications)
- **Logistics** → `logistics-service` (shipping, delivery tracking)
- **POS Operations** → `pos-service` (point of sale transactions)

## Removed Modules (Integrated with External Services)

### Finance/Accounting → Treasury Service

**Removed from ERP**: All financial management modules (accounts, expenses, taxes, payment, budgets, cashflow, reconciliation, invoicing, quotations) are now handled by `treasury-api`.

**Integration**: ERP publishes events and calls APIs:
- Invoice creation → `POST /api/v1/treasury/invoices`
- Bill creation → `POST /api/v1/treasury/bills`
- Payment processing → `POST /api/v1/treasury/payments`
- Expense recording → `POST /api/v1/treasury/expenses`

**Events Published**:
- `erp.invoice.required` - When opportunity is won
- `erp.bill.required` - When PO is received
- `erp.payroll.required` - When payroll is processed

### Inventory Management → Inventory Service

**Removed from ERP**: Stock inventory management is now handled by `inventory-service`.

**Integration**: ERP calls APIs for stock levels and movements:
- Stock levels → `GET /api/v1/inventory/items/{id}/stock`
- Stock movements → `POST /api/v1/inventory/movements`
- Stock adjustments → `POST /api/v1/inventory/adjustments`

**Events Published**:
- `erp.order.created` - For inventory reservation
- `erp.purchase_order.received` - For stock receipt
- `erp.work_order.completed` - For finished goods

### Authentication/Authorization → Auth Service

**Removed from ERP**: User management and authentication is now handled by `auth-service`.

**Integration**: ERP uses JWT validation and references user IDs:
- JWT validation → `shared/auth-client` library
- User sync → `GET /api/v1/auth/users/{id}`

### Notifications → Notifications Service

**Removed from ERP**: Notification sending is now handled by `notifications-service`.

**Integration**: ERP publishes events for notifications:
- `erp.invoice.created` → Invoice notification
- `erp.payroll.processed` → Payroll notification
- `erp.leave.requested` → Leave approval notification

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Testing
- Django test suites with TestCase
- Testcontainers for integration testing
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Performance testing for report generation

### Observability
- Structured logging (Python logging)
- Tracing via OpenTelemetry
- Metrics exported via Prometheus
- Distributed tracing via Tempo/Jaeger

### Security
- OWASP ASVS baseline
- TLS everywhere
- Secrets via Vault/Parameter Store
- Rate limiting & anomaly detection middleware
- JWT validation via auth-service
- Row-level security with tenant_id

### Scalability
- Stateless HTTP layer
- Background workers via Celery
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Query optimization (select_related/prefetch_related)

### Data Modelling
- Django models as single source of truth
- Tenant/outlet discovery webhooks
- Outbox pattern for reliable domain events
- Database migrations via Django migrations

---

## API & Protocol Strategy

- **REST-first**: Versioned routes (`/api/v1/{module}/`), documented via OpenAPI
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates (Django Channels)
- **Webhooks**: External provider callbacks, ERP events
- **Idempotency**: Keys, correlation IDs, distributed tracing context propagation

---

## Compliance & Risk Controls

- Align with Kenya Data Protection Act: explicit consent flows, user data export/delete endpoints, audit logging
- Financial compliance: Integration with treasury-api for double-entry bookkeeping, audit trails, financial reporting
- Tax compliance: KRA iTax integration (via treasury-api)
- Disaster recovery playbook, RTO/RPO targets (<1 hour)

---

## Sprint Delivery Plan

See `docs/sprints/` folder for detailed sprint plans:
- Sprint 0: Foundations
