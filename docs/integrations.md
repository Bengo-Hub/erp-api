# ERP Service - Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides detailed integration information for all external services and systems integrated with the ERP service. **ERP focuses on CRM, HRM, Procurement, Manufacturing, and E-commerce modules**, and integrates with specialized microservices for finance, inventory, authentication, and notifications.

## Integration Patterns

### 1. REST API Pattern (Synchronous)

**Use Case**: Data retrieval, immediate operations

**Implementation**:
- Django REST Framework HTTP client
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Request timeout (10 seconds default)
- Idempotency keys for mutations

### 2. Event-Driven Pattern (Asynchronous)

**Use Case**: Cross-service communication, notifications

**Transport**: Celery with RabbitMQ/NATS

**Flow**:
1. Service publishes event to message broker
2. Subscriber services consume event
3. Process event and update local state
4. Publish response events if needed

**Reliability**:
- At-least-once delivery
- Event deduplication via event_id
- Retry on failure
- Dead letter queue for failed events

### 3. Webhook Pattern (Callbacks)

**Use Case**: External provider callbacks, ERP events

**Implementation**:
- Webhook endpoints in ERP service
- Signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- Retry logic for failed deliveries
- Idempotency handling

### 4. Database Polling (Avoided)

**Note**: Polling is explicitly avoided. Use event-driven or webhook patterns instead.

## Two-Tier Configuration Management

### Tier 1: Developer/Superuser Configuration

**Visibility**: Only developers and superusers

**Configuration Items**:
- Database credentials
- External API credentials (for integrations)
- Encryption keys
- Service-to-service API keys

**Storage**:
- Encrypted at rest in database (AES-256-GCM)
- K8s secrets for runtime
- Vault for production secrets

### Tier 2: Business User Configuration

**Visibility**: Normal system users (tenant admins)

**Configuration Items**:
- Business settings
- Tax rates (references from treasury-api)
- Payment terms
- Notification preferences
- Report templates

**Storage**:
- Plain text in database (non-sensitive)
- Tenant-specific configuration tables

## Integration Security

### Authentication

**JWT Tokens**:
- Validated via auth-service
- Token claims include tenant_id for scoping

**API Keys** (Service-to-Service):
- Stored in K8s secrets
- Rotated quarterly

### Authorization

**Tenant Isolation**:
- All requests scoped by tenant_id
- Data access isolated per tenant
- Data isolation enforced at database level

### Secrets Management

**Encryption**:
- Secrets encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Decrypted only when used
- Key rotation every 90 days

---

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Retry Policies

**Exponential Backoff**:
- Initial delay: 1 second
- Max delay: 30 seconds
- Max retries: 3

### Circuit Breaker

**Implementation**:
- Opens after 5 consecutive failures
- Half-open after 60 seconds
- Closes on successful request

### Monitoring

**Metrics**:
- API call latency (p50, p95, p99)
- API call success/failure rates
- Event publishing success rates
- Integration health status

**Alerts**:
- High failure rate (>5%)
- Service unavailability
- Event delivery failures
- Integration timeout
